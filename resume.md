## Personal Projects

A curious, technical developer, I thrive on solving complex problems through code. With an explorer's mindset, I build using Rust, Go, and AI, focusing on clean architecture and automation. From training AI for terrain simulation to orchestrating home Kubernetes clusters, I dive into the unknown to create and learn.

### Selected Projects
- **AI Terrain Modeling:** Built a U-Net model to generate realistic terrain from Perlin noise for simulations.
- **Covert AI Agents:** Simulated multi-agent systems to study covert manipulation strategies.
- **Crypto Automation:** Created a trading bot to manage Uniswap v3 pool liquidity.
- **Rust Tooling:** Developed a CLI and gRPC backend for secure environment variable management.
- **Home Kubernetes Cluster:** Set up home automation and media server on a self-managed K8s cluster.
- **Terminal LLM CLI:** Built a Golang CLI AI chatbot with terminal and file system access for developers.

## Outside of Work

When not tinkering with ESP32 home automations or playing mechanic, I'm outdoors—camping, 4WDing, or relearning rock climbing. I experiment with cooking, diving into the science of food's effects on body and mind. I also enjoy deep chats with my partner about psychology and human behavior. Whether debugging systems or exploring the human brain, I’m fascinated by what makes things tick.
