## Personal Projects

A curious, technical developer, I thrive on solving complex problems through code. With an explorer's mindset, I build using Rust, Go, and AI, focusing on clean architecture and automation. From training AI for terrain simulation to orchestrating home Kubernetes clusters, I dive into the unknown to create and learn.

### Selected Projects
- **AI Terrain Modeling:** Trained a U-Net model to generate realistic terrain from Perlin noise for simulations.
- **Covert AI Agents:** Simulated multi-agent systems used to examine an LLM's capacity to maintain a secret motive.
- **ML Crypto Trading:** Gained knowledge of feature engineering, hyper-parameter tuning, and model evaluation.
- **Crypto Automation:** Built a trading bot to manage Uniswap v3 liquidity pool balancing.
- **Rust Tooling:** Created a CLI and gRPC backend for secure environment variable management.
- **Home Kubernetes Cluster:** Operate a home automation and media server on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster.
- **Terminal LLM CLI:** Developed a Golang CLI AI chatbot with terminal and file system access for developers.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not pushing AI into areas it probably shouldn't go or playing mechanic, I'm outdoors camping, 4WDing, or relearning rock climbing. I experiment with cooking, diving into the science of how food affects body and mind. I also enjoy deep chats with my partner about psychology and human behaviour. Whether debugging systems or exploring the human brain, I’m fascinated by what makes things tick.
