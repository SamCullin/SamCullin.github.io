## Personal Projects
Curious, creative, and deeply technical, I’m a developer who thrives on solving complex problems through code. I’m an explorer at heart — drawn to novel experiences and new technologies — and I bring that mindset to everything I build. Whether training AI models to simulate terrain, orchestrating Kubernetes clusters at home, or crafting tools in Rust and Go, I love diving into the unknown and figuring things out. I’m a problem solver who just happens to code, with a focus on clean architecture, thoughtful automation, and a constant drive to learn better ways to build.

### Selected Projects
- **AI Terrain Modeling:** Developed and implemented a U-Net model to algorithmically generate realistic terrain from Perlin noise, exploring advanced procedural generation techniques applicable to simulation or digital content creation.
- **Covert AI Agents:** Created a multi-agent simulation to assess agents ability to covertly manipulate other agents to gain advantage.
- **Crypto Automation:** Developed an automated trading bot to stream exchange data and rebalance Uniswap v3 pool liquidity.
- **Rust Tooling:** Created a CLI and gRPC backend for secure environment variable management using Rust.
- **Home Kubernetes Cluster:** Set up home automation and a media server on a self-managed K8s cluster.
- **Terminal LLM CLI:** Built a Golang-based CLI chatbot with access to terminal and file system for reduced dev context switching.
